          Be careful, changing this will cause the player to be added and removed from the appropriate groups based on
          their new
          allegiance.
          Note that if a player is already human and you set them to human again THEY WILL GET A ADDITIONAL LIFECODE.
          That means a
          zombie
          can still redeem their old lifecode and get points but this player will stay human. Players are human until
          ALL of their
          lifecodes are claimed.
          Setting a zombie to be a zombie does nothing. Weird things could happen if you set a player to be undeclared;
          maybe it
          will be fine and maybe it will break?
